<p> In the past I've neglected to publish things I wrote (especially source code) and so most of it I've lost. All of the interesting things I'm <b>currently</b> working on or have written since ~fall 2014 that I am legally allowed to publish are available at <a href="http://github.com/s2607">github.com</a>
