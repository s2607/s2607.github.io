<h2> Stuff I do/have done</h2>
<p> I'm currently enrolled at Liberty University as a computer science student. I work as a freelancer and have built proprietary software for Windows and Linux as well as some closed source embedded firmware (mostly for PIC micro controllers). I've also had the opportunity to work with apitronics on their agricultural automation tools. I was an intern at Verisign Inc (the company that runs .com and .net) and at a small Symantec contractor. I run sound and a Minecraft server for the small church I attend. </p>
<p> In the past I've neglected to publish things I wrote (especially source code) and so most of it I've lost. All of the interesting things I'm <b>currently</b> working on are available at <a href="github.com/s2607">Git-hub.com</a>
