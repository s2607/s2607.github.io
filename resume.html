<h3>Software Development Experience</h3>

<h4>C programming projects</h4>
<li> Embedded pic18 powered laser tag objective devices that communicated with a remote "arena control machine". 
<li> HP style stack based virtual machine.
<li> "falling sand game" for Nintendo Wii, simulates a small 2d world using a large array of finite state automata.
<li> 3d tank game engine with a text based level file format.
