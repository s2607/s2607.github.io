<title>go on android</title>
<body>
Have installe go and mesagl on gnetoo through emerge<br>
go get -d golang.org/x/mobile<br>
go get -d golang.org/x/mobile/example/sprite<br>
emerge droidfonts #or whatever<br>
ln -s /usr/share/fonts /usr/share/fonts/truetype<br>
you can now build and the sprite example as a linux binnary but it will gripe if you try to build it for android.<br>
cd $gosource && GOOS=android GOARCH=arm GOARM=7 CC_FOR_TARGET=arm-pc-linux-gnueabi-gcc emerge dev-lang/go<br>
builds but gripes it didnt install<br>
that should work as long as you have a cross compiler for arm installed (I tried to fix earlier erros by installing the android NDK which apears to have been a COMPLETE WASTE OF HALF A DAY'S WORTH OF DATA TRANSFER) the CC_FOR_TARGET environment variable prevents the -marm error from your host c compiler<br>


I also donloaded and built linux go with git (this worked as well, obviusly it didnt automaticly install)<br>
