#elementary row operations
1: multiply all elements in a row by a constant
2: interchange two rows
3: add a constant times one row to another

#row-echlon form
1: the first non-zero element in any row is 1
    this is called the "leading 1"
2: all zero rows are grouped at the bottom
3: leading 1s must never share columns or be farther to the left in lower rows then in higher rows
##reduced row-echlon form
4: columns containing leading 1s have zeros on all other rows

#reduction steps to convert to row-echlon form
The fist phase is always necisary and is suficient for row-echlon form, the backward phase is only necisary if you need reduced row-chlon form.
##forward phase
1: the leftmost column with nonzero elements is bow called the work column 
2: the top row has a zero in the work column interchange it with another row
3: multiply the top row by 1/(value in its work column)
    this makes that number a leading 1
4: for all rows with nonzero values in the work colum
    c= their work column value timez -1
    add c*top row to current row
    next work-nonzero row
5: pretend the top row doesnt exist, if there are still rows left repeat starting at step1
    else: stop pretending
##backward phase
6: for all rows a starting with the bottom most
    the column containing row a's leading 1 is now called the work column
    for all rows b that have nonzero elements in the work column
        c=-[b,workcolumn]
        add c*a to b ([b,workcolumn] now equals zero)
        next b
    next a

1-5 is gaussian eliminatoin
jordan gaussian elimination includes step 6
columns of all zeros are not altered by the change to row eclon form

#homogeneus
all elements of last column are 0
these systens have "trivial solutions" where all variables equal 0
they may also have infinite solutions, but may not have no solutions and must have a solution where every variable is zero

if a homogenous matrix has n+1 columns (the number of unknowns in the system of equations) and r nonzero rows:
    the system will have n-r free variables
note: a homogenios system with more unkowns then equations has infinitely many solutions

#back substitution
fast replacement for reduction step6 (returns solution, not reduced matrix)


    solve for the variables of each row
    sstart with the bottom row
